**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Description**

This is a project that has as a goal creating a website that can be displayed effectively in different screen resolutions, therefore, giving the user an excellent experience. Different technologies were used for this purpose:

  - HTML & CSS: We used grids, flexbox, relative units of measurement.
  - Git
  - GitHub
  - Figma
